# Glassmorphism-Figma
Here I have made a sample poster for Nike on their new product that is a sneaker. I have created this poster using Figma Tool using the UI/UX 
effect called "Glassmorphism" which gives a glass like transluscent appearance on the sneaker in the poster. I found it quite interesting and fun to make it!
